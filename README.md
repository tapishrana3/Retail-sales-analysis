Retail Sales Dataset (Kaggle)

Dataset Overview
The Retail Sales Dataset contains detailed information about products, sales, customers, stores, and regions.

Problem Statement
The manager wants us to analyze the sales performance and derive some key insights. They specifically want us to identify high-performing products and cities, and at the same time, suggest actionable strategies to improve low-performing regions.

Our task is to:

Analyze sales trends, such as which City or product is performing well.
Identify Top 5 products and best-performing stores.
Compare regions and categories where sales are high or low.


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
Total Sales: $2.30 million
Total Profit: $286.4K
Total Orders: 10K
Total Quantity Sold: 38K

Insights
Sales by Region:
The South region generates the lowest sales, contributing only 17.05% of total sales.

Best-Selling Segment:
The Consumer segment drives the highest sales among all segments.

Sales Trend Over Time:
Analyzing monthly sales trends reveals that sales peak during festive seasons, particularly in March and September.
Outside of these periods, sales show a slow but steady increase.

Bottom 5 Cities:
Cities like Jupiter and Abilene rank among the lowest in sales generation.
To improve overall performance, we should focus on targeted strategies in these cities to boost sales and profitability.

Bottom 5 Sub-Categories:
Fasteners and labels are among the lowest-performing sub-categories in terms of sales.
We should consider strategic improvements, such as increasing marketing efforts or replacing these sub-categories with higher-demand alternatives to enhance profitability

Conclusion
Now, based on these insights, we can optimize sales. We’ll manage high-performing products better, apply targeted strategies to underperforming categories.

With the gathered insights, we’ve made data-driven decisions that will help align inventory management, sales forecasting, and marketing campaigns more effectively.

Actionable Steps:
Limit sales promotions to high-performing segement and products.
Boost underperforming Sub-categories and cities with targeted campaigns.
Implement loyalty programs for customer retention using customer segmentation.
